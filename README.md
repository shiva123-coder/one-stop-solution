# ONE-STOP Solution

## Aim/ Purpose

- The ONE-STOP Solution is a website dedicated as a platform for various self-employed people who want to sell their skills and provide services to the communities. The   website allows users to search and view various services, register and add the applicable services as well as interact with the websiteâ€™s administrator to query and book available services. Furthermore, users can be added and removed by the admin. This website is my Milestone Project 3 for the Full Stack Developer course at Code Institute. In addition, I am planning to use this website to start my own online business in the near future.
